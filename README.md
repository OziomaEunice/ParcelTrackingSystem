# ParcelTrackingSystem
Building a parcel tracking system in C#


This is a project I did at uni and it was to create a system for parcels to be tracked and assigned to three forms of couriers:
- Van ðŸšš
- Cycle ðŸš´ 
- Walking ðŸš¶ 

Depending on the area and number of parcel, each will be allocated to a courier.

In addition, every order made by the client will be registered in a .xlsx document.
